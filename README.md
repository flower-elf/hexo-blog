# Hexo Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) site that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.


### How We Created This Example

To get started with Hexo for deployment with Vercel, you can use the [Hexo CLI](https://hexo.io/docs/index.html#Installation) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ hexo init project-name
```
test
